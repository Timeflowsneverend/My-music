            Well you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Staring at the bottom of your glass<br>
            Hoping one day you'll make a dream last<br>
            But dreams come slow and they go so fast<br>
            <br>
            You see her when you close your eyes<br>
            Maybe one day you'll understand why<br>
            Everything you touch surely dies<br>
            <br>
            But you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Staring at the ceiling in the dark<br>
            Same old empty feeling in your heart<br>
            Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast<br>
            <br>
            Well you see her when you fall asleep<br>
            But never to touch and never to keep<br>
            Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep<br>
            <br>
            Well you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Ohhh, oh no<br>
            And you let her go<br>
            Ohhh, oh no<br>
            Well you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Cause you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Cause you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
            <br>
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
            Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
            Only know you love her when you let her go<br>And you let her go
